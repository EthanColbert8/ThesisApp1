This is the source code written for my undergraduate thesis, entitled "Partial Automation of Data Analysis in a Z Prime Boson Search."

At its core, it iterates through a directory tree, finding files representing collision events in the ATLAS detector and applying filter criteria to search for Z boson processes.
